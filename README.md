## Story

I love cuisines, especially homemade dishes. I also enjoy cooking, and I started wondering: what if I had my own fridge that stored all my recipes? Whenever I want, I could just open it and listen to the recipes while cooking. That’s exactly why I made this project.

## Components

- **Languages**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python  
- **Editor**: 100% Visual Studio Code  
- **Browser**: Chrome  

## Obstacles

This was my first time using Google Text-to-Speech (converted directly in the VS Code terminal), and I found it confusing at first. But once I figured it out, it became incredibly convenient — the MP3 files are saved directly to my project folder!
